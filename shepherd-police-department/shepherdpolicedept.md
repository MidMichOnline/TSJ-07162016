> Thank you to Tina Sawyer (we aren't related...just share a cool last name) for a great radio interview. I had a chance to share my thoughts in the tragedy in Dallas, the calling to become a police officer, the incredible asset our youth are and much more. It will air on Saturday July 16th at 8:30 AM on 830AM.
She also invited me to join her and Matt on "That Show" on 104.3 FM this coming Tuesday at 8:20 AM.
Make sure you hug a loved one today, tell them what they mean to you because tomorrow is not promised!
Chief Sawyer
