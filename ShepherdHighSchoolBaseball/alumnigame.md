> Mark your calendars, August 28, 2016. That's the date for the second annual alumni game AND coach Nartker's retirement party. This is the same weekend for the first home football game and the alumni golf outing. As of now there will be three games: At 10:00 a.m. the older group will play, then 1:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. We are planning on roasting a pig and having everyone bring a dish to pass for the retirement party which will be after the conclusion of the first game.

> Alumni that played for coach Nartker should get a hold of him @ [989 560 6096](tel:9895606096) (texting works too) or call his office and ask for Shiela @ 989 828 6700. You can also email him @ jnnartker@yahoo.com.

> Please share this with as many as possible to get the word out.
